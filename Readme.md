I spent 2 hours working on a CommIT Smart Interview Devops Assignment. üòÅ

Its my second time using Google Cloud Platform for a project.

1. Create a Terraform configuration that provisions a GCP Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, including the necessary resources such as the cluster, nodes, and firewall rules.
2. Use Terraform to provision a GCP Persistent Disk and attach it to the cluster.
3. Use Terraform to provision a GCP Cloud SQL instance and create a database on it.
4. Use Terraform to provision a GCP Cloud Storage bucket and upload a file to it.
5. Use Git for version control and GitHub for code sharing.
6. Create a Kubernetes deployment and service configuration that deploys a simple web application on the cluster and exposes it to the internet.
7. Use your favorite CI/CD solution (Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc) to deploy Kubernetes resources.
8. Create a script that automates the process of applying the Terraform configuration.
